# Hydrology Data Processing and Analysis - MATLAB

This is a suite for processing and analyzing a broad range of data related to my study of watershed hydrology at UC Berkeley. Because the software needs were driven by exploratory scientific questions, the development was ad hoc and I wouldn't expect someone else to use the entire suite as-is. Furthermore, to do it over again, I would use Python/R rather than MATLAB. That said, there are some interesting coding challenges addressed within, so I've put some effort into organzing and documenting the code.
